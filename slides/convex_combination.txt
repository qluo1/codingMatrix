Hi,
I didn't really understand the convex combination part, can something please explain it to me, the wordier the better?
I understand we have a line made up of points in the plane scaling a point p by scalars 0 to 1. Then we went to translate it up to some point. I don;t understand what follows.
Thanks,
Eli.

I think there are a few ideas that should be understood to grasp this concept:
We can think of points as vectors which can be added together and scaled. For simplicity I will use the phrase point instead of vector here.
A combination of points is some way of combining the points to yield a new point. There are different types of combinations. I will 
list a few types:

- Linear Combination: Given points p,q and real numbers a,ß we yield the new point a·p+ß·q. An example would be 3(2,1)+2(1,0)=(8,3).

- Convex Combination: Given points p,q and real numbers a,ß=0 with a+ß=1 we yield the new point a·p+ß·q. An example would be .3(2,1)+.7(1,0)=(1.3,.3).

- Affine Combination: Given points p,q and real numbers a,ß with a+ß=1 we yield the new point a·p+ß·q. An example would be 3(2,1)+(-2)(1,0)=(4,3).

These can be extended to more than one point.

If we take the set of all possible convex combinations of two points, we get the line segment between them. For example,
{a(2,1)+ß(1,0)|a,ß=0,a+ß=1}
is the set of all points on the line segment between (2,1) and (1,0). To see why this is true, we can write ß=1-a and get
a(2,1)+ß(1,0)=a(2,1)+(1-a)(1,0)=(1,0)+a((2,1)-(1,0)).
If we take the set of all possible affine combinations of two points, we get the line through them.
If we take the set of all linear combinations of two points, we the linear subspace spanned by the two points.
